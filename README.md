Public Tutorial (from Gary Simon's DesignCourse): Build an exercise interval timer using Ionic4/Angular


Gary Simon has a fantastic learning resource for those interested in learning more about mobile development using the Ionic 4 cross-platform framework. His (1h7m) video here: [Ionic 4 Crash Course for Beginners - Build an App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTdwUpQRptc) is a really fun way to experience a full build cycle. Â 

Again, this is not an systematic or exhaustive approach to the Ionic framework, just a fun "get your hands dirty" exploration, with the added benefit of a cool little demo you can  show to your friends: __"hey, look at my app!"__
