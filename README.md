Public Tutorial (from Gary Simon's [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow)): Build an exercise interval timer using Ionic4/Angular

Suffix: **I**onic **4** A**ng**ular with a  **v**ersion number of **0** (in case my boys want to start extending this one).


Gary Simon has a fantastic learning resource for those interested in learning more about mobile development using the Ionic 4 cross-platform framework. His (1h7m) video here: [Ionic 4 Crash Course for Beginners - Build an App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTdwUpQRptc) is a really fun way to experience a full build cycle. Â 

Again, this is not an systematic or exhaustive approach to the Ionic framework, just a fun "get your hands dirty" exploration, with the added benefit of a cool little demo you can  show to your friends: _"hey, look at my app!"_

We'll also expend some effort devdeloping a practical git-to-GitHub strategy & methodology, because right now, I know diddly-squat about git and GitHub.  I grew up in the "bad old days" of `cvs` (_pray you never have to use it!_) and `svn` (which I _used_ to be "jealous" of, but we weren't using on our project). Hah!

Have to say, I'm impressed by git/GitHub.  But, just like any firearm, you have to understand safety, and have an instinct to keep  the "danger-end of the stick" pointed in the "safe-ish" direction (downrange).  And, it's got a lot of control buttons, so like any (too?) complex weapon system, if you're not careful, you can end up with eternal regret that you pushed the wrong button or twisted the wrong knob.  So I reconl it's worth thinking about, and getting some practice in on it.

_It's all good clean fun, right?  What could go wrong?_

_Hello?...  Hello?  Come in!  Are you there?..._

Here's our process so far:

- [initialize the project & synch remote (GitHub) and local repos](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/1)
- [resolve security warnings for npm package dependencies](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/3)
- [simulate mobile device deployment using Ionic Lab viewer/server](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/4)
- [simulate mobile device deployment using Firefox responsive/mobile view](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/5)
- [establish the project git-to-GitHub strategy](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/6)
- [eliminate the default header display](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/7)
- [change the primary color for the app](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/8)
- [change the background color to black](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/9)
- [add (central timer display element): circular progress bar](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/11)
- [add feature: Total Workout Duration](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/15)
- [adjust spacing/positions of control elements](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/16)
    - NB:  We break away (temporarily) from Gary's development path here.
- [add "start" & "stop" buttons (using "ion-fab")](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/17)
    - Note the (non-trivial) use of Angular conditional expressions for this implementation.
- [add "keep-awake" feature to avoid timeouts from inactivity ](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/19)
- [give the app an installation name](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/21)


To-Dos Include:
- [resolve security warning for component: serialize-javascript](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/2)
- [resolve npm warning: "peer dependencies" for karma-jasmine & jasmine-core?](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/12)
- [follow-up: Survey features & capabilities of `ng-circle-progress`](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/13)
- [follow-up: Study additional useful git-to-GitHub process methodlogies](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/10)
- [follow-up: Understand Ionic4 "slots" concept(s)](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/18)
    - NB: Potential missing documentation issue for Ionic.
- [follow-up: customize the app icon(s)?](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/22)
- [resolve: Should ./resources subdir be kept under git version control?](https://github.com/dpcunningham/exertimer_i4ng_v0/issues/23)
